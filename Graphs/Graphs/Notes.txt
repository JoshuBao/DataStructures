Dijkstra's Algorithm


1/19/2019
your done with the ^^ algorithm, just get it checked and finish the loop path comment thing


Unit Test Airport-ALEXISBAD:
Read the given txt file called AirportProblem
The first line is telling you how many paths to check
The lines after that are the paths from start to end
After the paths if is just the edges (start,end,distance)
Create a graph using the edges given to you
Then do Dijkstra from the start to end for each path and see if it matches up with the given paths

 //add a Vertex<T> search(T value) returns null if the item does not exist
        //return the vertex if the item exists

		your doing airport thing, and then apply it to the unit test ^^^^ airport project
